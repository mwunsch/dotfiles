These are my dotfiles. They are conveniently presented as a [homesick castle](http://github.com/technicalpickles/homesick). You can `gem install homesick` and then `homesick clone git://github.com/mwunsch/dotfiles.git`

Alternatively, you can use [GNU Stow](http://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) to manage the symlink.
